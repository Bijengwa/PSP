# Overnight Log

## 2026-10-07 — M1.1 Layout foundation

**Changed**
- `web/src/management/inApp/dashboard.tsx`: the default export `Dashboard` is now `OfficeLayout`. It keeps the sidebar region, the header region (name, role, Log out) and the logout error alert. The workspace (`<main className="office-main">`) now renders `<Outlet />`. The sidebar link label changed from "Dashboard" to "Home".
- Same file: new named export `OfficeHome`, the Home page with the "Home" title and "Welcome, {fullName}." text.
- `web/src/App.tsx`: inside `RequireAuth`, a layout route `<OfficeLayout />` wraps the index route `<OfficeHome />`. Both are lazy-loaded from the same office chunk. The `/office/*` catch-all `NotFound` stays outside the layout (it moves into the shell in M1.3).

**Not changed**
- Auth wiring: `AuthProvider`, `RequireAuth`, `login.tsx`, `api/client.ts` and the backend. No CSS, no new dependencies.

**Verified**
- `npm run build` (web): passed.
- `npm run lint` (web): passed, no warnings.
- `node` tests: not run, because there were no backend changes.
- Login and logout were checked only by reading the code. No browser run was done: the login, redirect and logout code paths are untouched, and the Log out button still calls `useAuth().logout()`.

**Notes for the user**
- `OfficeHome` lives in `dashboard.tsx` so that no new file had to be created without approval. If you want it in its own file (for example `web/src/management/inApp/home.tsx`), say where, and it can be moved in a later step.
- Next step: M1.2 Sidebar + navigation. It was not started.

## 2026-10-07 — M1.2 Sidebar + navigation

**Changed**
- `web/src/management/inApp/dashboard.tsx`: a `NAV_GROUPS` list holds the §2 groups and items (Home; Catalog: Products, Add Product, Inventory; Sales: Orders, Customers; Management: Staff, Reports; System: Notifications, Settings). The sidebar renders one labelled `<ul>` per group (an `h2` heading tied to the list with `aria-labelledby`), with a `NavLink` per item. Every link uses `end`, so Products is not highlighted on `/office/products/new`.
- `web/src/App.tsx`: element-less child routes inside `OfficeLayout` for `products`, `products/new`, `inventory`, `orders`, `customers`, `staff`, `reports`, `notifications`, `settings`. Each renders the shell with an empty workspace, because page content belongs to M1.3. Unknown `/office/*` paths still hit the old full-page NotFound (it moves into the shell in M1.3).
- `web/src/index.css`: styles for group headings (`.office-nav-heading`) and lists (`.office-nav-list`), a hover state for `.office-nav-link`, and links set to `display: block`. The active style (`.active`, set by `NavLink` along with `aria-current="page"`) is unchanged.

**Not changed**
- Auth wiring, the header and logout, the backend. No mobile drawer (M1.5), no page content (M1.3). No new files or dependencies.

**Verified**
- `npm run build` (web): passed.
- `npm run lint` (web): passed, no warnings.
- `node` tests: not run, because there were no backend changes.
- The "Done when" items (every item navigates, the active item is highlighted, keyboard navigation works) were checked **only by reading the code**. No browser run was done, and a small runtime check script could not be run because writing outside the project needs a permission this session does not have. Reasoning: each sidebar path has a matching route inside the layout. The links are real `<a>` elements in document order, so Tab, Shift+Tab and Enter work, and the global `:focus-visible` outline shows focus. `NavLink` sets `.active` and `aria-current="page"` on the current item. A quick manual click-through in the browser is still worth doing.

**Notes for the user**
- At the start, a Collision Guard hook said another session (78b38214) had edited `dashboard.tsx`, `App.tsx` and these docs a few minutes earlier. `git status` showed a clean tree apart from this step's own edits, so it was taken to be the committed M1.1 work.
- On narrow screens (≤768px) the full sidebar list currently stacks above the workspace. This is expected until the M1.5 drawer.
- Next step: M1.3 Placeholder workspace pages. It was not started.

## 2026-10-07 — M1.3 Placeholder workspace pages

**Changed**
- `web/src/management/inApp/dashboard.tsx`: two new named exports.
  - `PlaceholderPage({ title })` renders only `<h1 className="office-title">{title}</h1>`.
  - `OfficeNotFound` shows a "Not found" title, one line of text and a link back to Home (`/office`).
- `web/src/App.tsx`: each sidebar route (`products`, `products/new`, `inventory`, `orders`, `customers`, `staff`, `reports`, `notifications`, `settings`) now renders `PlaceholderPage` with its sidebar label as the title. The `/office/*` catch-all moved inside `OfficeLayout` and now renders `OfficeNotFound`, so unknown office paths show inside the shell and stay behind `RequireAuth`. The top-level `*` NotFound for non-office paths is unchanged. Both new components are lazy-loaded from the office chunk, like `OfficeHome`.

**Not changed**
- The sidebar, header, logout, auth wiring, CSS and backend. No new files or dependencies.

**Verified**
- `npm run build` (web): passed.
- `npm run lint` (web): passed, no warnings.
- `node` tests: not run, because there were no backend changes.
- "No placeholder fetches data": `PlaceholderPage` and `OfficeNotFound` are plain render functions with no hooks, effects or API calls.
- "Each route shows its title": checked by reading the code (each route passes the matching title). No browser run was done.

**Notes for the user**
- §2 lists Notifications as `"No notifications"` until its stage, but the M1.3 scope says "title only". The page currently shows only the title "Notifications". If you want the "No notifications" line added on the page too, say so. The M1.4 header popover will show "No notifications" either way.
- The Collision Guard hook again flagged a recent edit by another session (28d23d15). Re-reading the files showed only this step's edits on top of the committed M1.2 work, so nothing was overwritten.
- Next step: M1.4 Header. It was not started.

## 2026-10-07 — M1.4 Header

**Changed**
- `web/src/management/inApp/dashboard.tsx`:
  - The header now has the page title on the left. It is looked up from the current path (sidebar labels, plus "Change password"; anything else shows "Not found"). It is a `<p>`, not a heading, because each workspace page already has its own `h1`.
  - `NotificationsPopover`: a bell icon button (inline SVG, `aria-label="Notifications"`, `aria-haspopup="dialog"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) opens a non-modal `role="dialog"` popover that says "No notifications". Focus moves into the popover when it opens.
  - `ProfileMenu`: the avatar, name and role button (`aria-haspopup="menu"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) opens a menu. It shows name and role from `useAuth()`, then a `role="menu"` list with `role="menuitem"` entries: Profile, Change password (routes to `/office/auth/change-password`) and Settings (routes to `/office/settings`). Keyboard: ArrowDown/ArrowUp on the button open the menu on the first/last item; ArrowUp/Down (wrapping), Home and End move between items; Enter activates.
  - Both popovers close on Escape (focus returns to the button), on a pointer press outside, when focus is tabbed out, and when the button is clicked again. Opening one closes the other, because that click counts as outside.
  - New exported constant `CHANGE_PASSWORD_PATH`.
  - The Log out button stays in the header until M1.7 moves it to Settings.
- `web/src/App.tsx`: a placeholder route `auth/change-password` ("Change password") inside the shell, so the menu entry lands on a placeholder until M2.1/M2.2 replace it.
- `web/src/index.css`: header title and actions, icon/profile buttons, popover, menu and disabled-item styles. The unused `.office-user` rule was removed.

**Not changed**
- Auth wiring, the backend, the sidebar and the placeholder pages. No real notifications, no profile editing, no mobile drawer. No new files or dependencies.

**Verified**
- `npm run build` (web): passed.
- `npm run lint` (web): passed. The first run flagged `react-hooks/refs`, because refs were passed into a helper during render. This was fixed by using `event.currentTarget` in the blur handler instead.
- `node` tests: not run, because there were no backend changes.
- The "Done when" checks (open and close with mouse and keyboard, Escape, outside click, ARIA roles) were checked **by reading the code only**. No browser run was done: the session could not check whether Postgres and Redis were running without extra approval. A manual check in the browser is still worth doing.

**Notes for the user**
- **Profile** is shown in the menu as a disabled item (`aria-disabled`), because the own-profile page belongs to M4.3 and §2 has no route for it. If you would rather hide it until M4.3, or point it somewhere, say so.
- The change-password placeholder renders *inside* the shell. M2.1 builds the real page outside the shell, as §2 says, and will need to move this route.
- The header title repeats the workspace `h1` on each page, because the plan asks for both. On narrow screens the profile button still shows the full name; the compact mobile header is M1.5.
- The Collision Guard hook again reported recent edits by other sessions (80b8c5fd, 28d23d15). `git status` showed only this step's changes, so nothing was overwritten.
- Nothing was committed.
- Next step: M1.5 Responsive/mobile. It was not started.

## 2026-10-07 — M1.5 Responsive/mobile (implemented, NOT ticked)

**Changed**
- `web/src/management/inApp/dashboard.tsx` (`OfficeLayout`):
  - A hamburger button (`aria-label="Open navigation"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) sits left of the page title in the header. It is shown only at ≤768px, the breakpoint the CSS already used.
  - At ≤768px the sidebar is an overlay drawer. While it is open it has `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"` and `aria-label="Office navigation"`, and the rest of the page (`.office-body`) is `inert`. The mobile state comes from `matchMedia` through `useSyncExternalStore` (`MOBILE_QUERY`), so on desktop the sidebar keeps its plain landmark semantics.
  - The drawer closes when you choose a nav item or the brand link, tap the backdrop, press Escape, or use a new "Close navigation" button in the drawer head.
  - Focus moves to the close button when the drawer opens and back to the hamburger when it closes.
  - New private icons `MenuIcon` and `CloseIcon` (inline SVG, no emoji).
- `web/src/index.css`:
  - The ≤768px block no longer stacks the sidebar above the page. It now styles the off-canvas drawer: `min(280px, 85vw)` wide, slides in with `transform`, and is hidden with `visibility` when closed so its links cannot be tabbed to. A backdrop sits behind it.
  - A compact 56px header: the profile button shows the avatar only, and the name and role stay in the accessible name through a visually-hidden style.
  - Popovers are anchored to the header (`right: 12px`, `max-width: calc(100% - 24px)`) so they stay on screen at 360px.
  - The header title has `flex: 1`. The hamburger, close button and backdrop are hidden on desktop. Transitions are turned off under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

**Not changed**
- Auth wiring, the backend, the sidebar items, the placeholder pages, and how the header popovers behave. The Log out button stays in the header until M1.7. No theme work (M1.6). No new files or dependencies.

**Verified**
- `npm run build` (web): passed.
- `npm run lint` (web): passed, no warnings.
- `node` tests: not run, because there were no backend changes.
- 360px overflow check, by arithmetic only. Header at 360px: 12px padding on each side leaves 336px. That holds the hamburger (40), two 8px gaps, and the actions (bell 40, avatar 40, Log out about 86, gaps 8 = about 174), leaving about 106px for the title, which is ellipsised. The drawer is at most 85vw and popovers are capped to the header width. Nothing found that should scroll sideways.
- **Not verified in a browser.** "Done when: checked at 360px, 768px and desktop widths" needs a real viewport check. This session was not allowed to open the Chrome DevTools browser tool or to check whether Postgres and Redis are running. `vite preview` was started and then stopped without being used. So, as CLAUDE.md requires, **M1.5 is not ticked** in `docs/progress.md`, and the current step stays M1.5.

**To finish M1.5 (manual check)**
1. With the API running, log in and open `/office` in DevTools device mode at 360px, 768px and 1280px.
2. At 360px and 768px: the hamburger shows. It opens the drawer and focus lands on the close button. Tab stays inside the drawer. Each of these closes it with focus back on the hamburger: Escape, tapping the backdrop, choosing an item. There is no horizontal scrollbar, including with the Notifications and Profile popovers open.
3. At 1280px: the sidebar is always visible and there is no hamburger.
4. If all of that passes, tick M1.5 and set the current step to M1.6.

**Notes for the user**
- 768px counts as mobile (drawer), because the existing breakpoint is `max-width: 768px`. If you want the full sidebar at exactly 768px, the breakpoint needs to drop to 767px in both `index.css` and `MOBILE_QUERY`.
- The Collision Guard hook reported recent edits by another session (2a0d793a) to `dashboard.tsx` and `index.css`. `git status` showed only this step's changes, so nothing was overwritten.
- The GateGuard hook asked for facts before the first edits. They were given and the edits went ahead.
- Nothing was committed. M1.6 was not started.

## 2026-10-07 — M1.5 Responsive/mobile (second attempt, still NOT ticked)

**Changed**
- No code changes. The M1.5 implementation from the previous entry (commit 22a066d) is unchanged.

**Verified**
- `npm run build` (web): passed.
- `npm run lint` (web): passed, no warnings.
- `node` tests: not run, because there were no backend changes.
- **Browser check still not done.** The plan was to run the Vite dev server and open `/office` in the Chrome DevTools tool at 360px, 768px and 1280px. `/api/auth/me` would be stubbed inside the browser only (no code change), so Postgres and Redis would not be needed. The dev server started, but permission to use the Chrome DevTools tool (`new_page`) was refused, so the check could not run. The dev server was stopped. Checks for whether Postgres and Redis were listening were also blocked by the permission prompts.
- So, as CLAUDE.md requires, M1.5 stays unticked in `docs/progress.md`, and the current step stays **M1.5**.

**To finish M1.5**
- Either do the manual check listed under "To finish M1.5" in the entry above, or allow the `plugin:ecc:chrome-devtools` tools for this project so a later run can do it. After that, tick M1.5 and set the current step to M1.6.

**Notes for the user**
- The Collision Guard hook reported an edit to this log by another session (e7161d7d) two minutes before this entry. The file's tail matched the committed M1.5 entry, so nothing was overwritten.
- M1.6 was not started. Nothing was committed by this run.

## 2026-10-07 — M1.5 Responsive/mobile (third attempt, still NOT ticked)

**Changed**
- No code changes. The M1.5 implementation from commit 22a066d is unchanged.

**Verified**
- `npm run build` (web): passed.
- `npm run lint` (web): passed, no warnings.
- `node` tests: not run, because there were no backend changes.
- **Browser check still not done.** The Vite dev server was started on port 5199. The plan was to replace `/api/auth/me` inside the browser only, using a navigation init script, so no code change was needed. Permission to use the Chrome DevTools tool (`new_page`) was refused again. The dev server was stopped. Chrome was not launched any other way, because that would get around the refused permission.
- So, as CLAUDE.md requires, M1.5 stays unticked in `docs/progress.md`, and the current step stays **M1.5**.

**To finish M1.5**
- This is the third run that has stopped at the same point. Running again will not help until one of these is done:
  - do the manual check under "To finish M1.5" in the first M1.5 entry, then tick M1.5 and set the current step to M1.6, or
  - allow the `mcp__plugin_ecc_chrome-devtools__*` tools (at least `new_page`, `navigate_page`, `resize_page`, `evaluate_script`, `take_snapshot`, `press_key`, `click`) for this project, so the overnight run can do the check itself.

**Notes for the user**
- The Collision Guard hook reported an edit to this log by another session (c7e5e89d) a minute before this entry. The file's tail was re-read and matched the second-attempt entry, so nothing was overwritten.
- M1.6 was not started. Nothing was committed by this run.
